Looking at the nouns (and verbs) in your use case to figure out classes and methods is called textual analysis.

A good use case clearly and accurately explains what a system does, in language that's easily understand. With a good use case complete, textual analysis is a quick and easy wait to figure out the classes in your system.

Pay attention to the nouns in your use case, even when they aren't classes in your system.
Think about how the classes you do have can support the behavior your use case describes.

Architecture is your design structure, and highlights the most important parts of your app, and the relationships between those parts.

The things in your application that are really important are architecturally significant, and you should focus on them FIRST.

Using proven OO design principles results in more maintainable, flexible, and extensible software.

**OO Principles.**
- Encapsulate what varies
- Code to an Interface rather than to an implementation
- Each class in your application should have only on reason to change.
- Classes are about behavior and functionality
